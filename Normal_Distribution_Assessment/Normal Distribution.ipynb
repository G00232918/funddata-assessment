When data is presented symmetrically on a diagram, the most common values will show as a bell curve which is usually the Normal Distribution point. "

The mean is the average of your dataset, how it is calculated is where if you add up the values of the dataset and devide by the number of the values. Standard deviation is based on the mean calculation. It is really how spread out the numbers are. For example a low standard deviation means that the data are clustered around the mean and on the other hand if there is a high standard deviation they are spread out. "

With the bell-curve they can then pinpoint the problem areas and also learn from the employee groups on the higher end of the group as a whole."
