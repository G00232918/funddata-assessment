- Firstly urllib.request is imported to be able to handle internet HTTP requests. For this example Alice in Wonderland was used. With the book defined as an element, the text is in then decoded for the purpose of the program.
- The text is then set to all lower case so the code and can more usuable for the programmer. Anything that is not a letter or space is then removed. 
- To get random charcaters random is imported.
- The book is then set to a whole string to be weighted. To get an accurate repesentation of average, weight is used. More often, if you use just the average you can get biased results.
- Generate a string using the weights with the constraint of weights, this will lead to less suprises according Shannon.
- Once the string is generated, you then get how many times letters follow each other. This is known as model in relation to machine learning. 
- Set the element to get the "e" as twos, then the range is set. The next element is to get the previous character as the last character. Randomly pick the next character from the weights. The character is then appended to the twos element. 

## Exercise 1 - Adapt the code from the lecture notes to generate a 1000 character long string with weights based on the previous two characters.
- Set the parameters for the 2 characters.
- Set the range for a 1000 so the string would meet requirements.
- In the next elements they are to set where the character is pulled from in the dataset.
- Once the dictionaries are got, both dictionaries are put together/
- Set as an ordered list.
- Randomly pickk the next character after the set parameters.
- Then append the characters.

# 02 - Randomness
## Exercise 1 - It is somewhat interesting that (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) perfectly divides (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) - there's no remainder.
If we only wanted exactly four heads as opposed to five, the equivalent calculation would be (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1).
Does that evenly divide too? What is the formula in general?
Does it always come out as a positive whole number?

- Calculation to see does (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) divide evenlly and it returned a whole number -210/
- Binomial Distribution formula is then explained, which briefly is a formula that has two possible outcomes.
- An image to show Binomial Distribution with the elements explained.
- A brief summary of Binomial Distribution showing a negative number. It is when the probability is not set to 0.5.
- Coding example of negative Binomial Distribution.

## Exercise 2 
- Explain why there are the same number of ways to get 4 tails as there is to get 4 heads.
- Brief explanation as to why you have the same chance of getting 4 heads or 4 tails.
- Coding example to demonstrate.

## Exercise 3
- Plot bar charts or histograms of any three different distributions listed at the following link:

https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html#distributions

* Dirichlet distribution
- This distribution is used in probability when you have more than 2 options.
- Firstly the variable and values need to be set.
- Tranpose the row elements int column elements.
- Then the sets are code.

### Poisson distribution
- This distribution estimates how many times an occurs in a specified time. For example, how many times a person eats in the day.
- Get the random range.
- Use the Posssion method.
- Plot the histogram.

#### Exponential Distribution
This distribution is a follow from Poisson, the difference being this is the probability distribution of the time between events in a Poisson point process.

# 03 - Bias
### Reading 
- Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases;
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman; Science, New Series, Vol. 185, No. 4157. (Sep. 27, 1974), pp. 1124-1131. - From the paper, I believe the real-life example that this theory relates to the most is placing a bet. It references the gambler's fallacy where the bettor is betting on red or black. When red comes up they think black will probably come up next. It may happen but then again it may take a few more turns so inevitably the results become more diluted. There is different examples given throughout the paper, one in particular that shows how people think is with the marbles.

I'll go back to the bettor, you have a set of data there where you can check form and frequencies of when team or horse won. From this you can try to predict based on similar scenarios where a team or horse won. Then you introduce the anchoring where the bettor deviates towards a selection based on a previous experience. This can cloud your judgement if you have a history or affinity to the selection for example, you have backed horses from the same yard and they won. 

- https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-regression/ - Understand what is meant by regression in the paper. It is how to understand how variables can be important to the relationship where dependent or independent. 

- The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice;
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman; Science, Vol. 211, 30 January 1981. - This paper is mostly related to person being subjected to making a decision which is risk averse or risk taking. You can see that people are more risk averse for making decision that impact human life and there is more chance of risk taking when it comes to money.
